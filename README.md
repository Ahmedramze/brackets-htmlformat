bracketsHTMLFormat
==================

Brackets extension adding HTML Format commands to menu bar and common keyboard shortcuts.

The main purpose behind this extension was to add common hotkeys to insert Bold and Italic 
tags around highlighted copy in HTML documents. My coworkers started talking about Brackets 
and that I should use it. I gave it a shot, but the lack of common HTML hotkeys caused me to 
look into making an extension for adding in something that I use everyday.

This is my first Brackets extension and first GIT, so please go easy on me if I did it wrong.
